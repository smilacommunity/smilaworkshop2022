Smiling and Laughter are crucial communicative means in our interaction and can affect importantly the
meaning of our utterances, the unfolding of the dialogue and the relationship between interactants. Previous research provided us with important insights into the role of smiling and laughter in interaction, how they "work" and how to process them. Nevertheless, there are still many open questions and under-explored areas of investigation, which given the multidimensional nature of smiling and laughter need a
multidisciplinary approach to be addressed. The main aim of our workshop is therefore to highlight these still unresolved questions encouraging
sharing in terms of insights, methods, and resources across domains and fields, in order to further boost
the interdisciplinary collaborations which are already intrinsically at the core of the community. As a multidisciplinary workshop, we invite contributors of different backgrounds to share their work
revolving around smiling and laughter with the main goal to push further the boundaries reached by
previous work, to improve the fluidity of resources exchanges and inter-disciplinary collaborations in
order to deepen our understanding of these communicative displays and build applications able to
recognise, process, and produce them when desirable.
