### The SmiLa Community
We are a multidisciplinary community interested in laughter and smiling: from understanding their use in communication to building technological modules involving them (detection systems, synthesis systems, etc.).
If laughter and/or smiling are of interest to you and if you are looking for a dynamic community to collaborate and exchange with, don't hesitate to join our community channels or at least get in touch! :)
